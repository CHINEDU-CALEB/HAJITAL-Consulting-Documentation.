# HAJITAL-Consulting-Documentation.

This is where i started my portofolio building while taking my data analysis training with Hajital Consulting.
I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Microsoft Excel, to Structured Query Language (SQL), power BI, Python and now my portfolio building with GitHub.
